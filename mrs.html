          With concerns of financial protection as well as being health conscious Samaj members faced a very real problem; having to pay large, unexpected medical costs is a major challenge. SCLP Samaj Medical Relief Scheme (MRS) was launched with its first three-year term commencing on 1st September 1995 with approximately 980 contributors. The MRS committee strives to ensure its beneficiaries have continuous healthcare at low and reasonable premiums. MRS contributors are assisted to meet and defray certain costs of inpatient treatment received.
        </p>
        <p style="text-align:center; margin-bottom: 24px;">
          In terms of claims for medical treatments, other than for cosmetic surgeries, today in 2018, more than 580 claims have been made. Currently 4,442 contributors to this scheme pay lower premiums for those aged below 50 years than those above this age. Likewise, we have ties with Sterling & HCG Medisurge Hospital that gives certain discounts to our members with support from Shree Kutchi Leva Patel Samaj, Ahmedabad, who also assists in paying some percentage of medical bills for patients who are financially challenged.
