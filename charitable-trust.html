        Welfare towards humanity has always been in the forefront of our community. The SCLP Charitable Trust was founded on June 23, 1996 to care for the local community by providing relief with charitable and calamity aid in different parts of Kenya. Under the Trust, the BOG governs the Shree Cutchi Leva Patel Samaj School Nairobi and also disburses funding for education to local students. The Youth League collaborates on environmental awareness initiatives including tree planting, while the open-to-all Medical Clinic provides care to more than 50 patients daily at concessional rates. The Samaj Medical Clinic is facilitated with a laboratory, dental clinic, pharmacy and more recently, optical and orthopaedic services.
